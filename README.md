# Tourism-Travel_Management_System
I created a travel and tourism management system website using HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Servlet, JSP, and MySQL. The system includes both frontend and backend functionalities, ensuring efficient management of travel-related information. All details are securely stored in a MySQL database through established database connectivity.
